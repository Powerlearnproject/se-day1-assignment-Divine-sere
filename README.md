Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is an engineering branch associated with the production of software products  using well defined principles and procedures. 
software engineering is improtant as it provides the everyone which solutions to problems, it helps with networking and it link people together no matter the distance. it helps solve problems for example the map is used to tell you when there is traffic in a place and gives you better option on a route to use. it makes life way much easier   

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Birth of Software Engineering (1968) – The NATO Software Engineering Conference introduced the term, addressing the "software crisis" and promoting structured development practices.
Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s-1990s) – Languages like C++ and Java popularized OOP, improving software modularity, reusability, and maintainability.
Agile Manifesto (2001) – Agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban replaced rigid processes, emphasizing iterative development, collaboration, and adaptability.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. analysis phase: in the phase the programmer or engineer has to undertand what exactly the user is looking for in the software. the engineer provides a solution for a problem
2. The design phase: Giving detailed designs for the software and navigating if it is user
3. implementation phase: the is the implementation of the software code and design is finalised as a software product 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The key difference between Waterfall and Agile methodologies is that Waterfall follows a linear, sequential approach where each project phase must be completed before moving to the next, while Agile emphasizes iterative development with flexible phases, allowing for frequent feedback and adaptation to changing requirements throughout the project lifecycle. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. A software developer: they are responsible for the building of the projec which involves reading and writing of the code. the fix bugs and generally make inprovement on how to make the application easier for the user whivh is generally known as the maintainaes 
2.A quality assurance engineer: A quality assurance manager is resonsible for making sure that what ever project is being put out is up to standard and the quality is tested by quality testers. If any part of the project is looking under standard is is sent for chnages 
3. A project manager: they are responsilbe for the decision of the project which will be worked on. He makes decision also on how to make the application easier for users. 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1. Integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that helps programmers develop software code efficiently. It increases developer productivity by combining capabilities such as software editing, building, testing, and packaging in an easy-to-use application.
2. pycharm and visual studio
  
3. Version control is crucial in software development as it efficiently manages and tracks changes to code over time, facilitating team collaboration and project progress tracking.What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
4. git and github


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1;Unit Testing
Tests individual components (e.g., functions, methods).Ensures correctness at the smallest level.Typically automated and written by developers.
2.Integration TestingTests how different modules or components interact.Identifies issues in data flow and communication between units.Uses approaches like top-down, bottom-up, and sandwich testing.
3.System TestingTests the complete system as a whole.Verifies compliance with functional and non-functional requirements.Includes performance, security, and usability testing.
4.Acceptance TestingEnsures the software meets business and user requirements.Performed by end-users or stakeholders.Includes User Acceptance Testing (UAT) and Beta Testing.
Each type plays a crucial role in delivering high-quality, error-free software

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering the way which talk to ai or guide ai machines to make the interaction with used easier. its a series of intraction with the ai which leads it to do the desired work.
propmting is important as it help the ai give you or the user get his desired results 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
what happened in 1960?
what happened in Nigeria in 1960?
The improved prompt helps narrow what exact location i'm looking for it tell the ai machine the i want information primarily from what happened in Nigerin and not just the whole world history
